        <h1>Project 1</h1>
        <h2>Sprint 1: Light Challenge</h2>

        <h3>EXPERIMENTATION - Circuit</h3>
        <p>First, I started by experimenting with just one Neopixel. Below is how the circuit was first hooked up.</p>
        <div class="image" id="one_neopixel1"></div>
        <div class="image" id="one_neopixel2"></div>
        <p>Then, I hooked up two Neopixels to a breadboard. This was a little more difficult than hooking up just one Neopixel, however, I did not have too much trouble with it.</p>
        <div class="image" id="two_neopixel1"></div>

        <h3>EXPERIMENTATION - Light</h3>
        <p>With this circuit running, I decided I would play around with different light effects by finding household items to diffuse or reflect the light from the Neopixels. </p>

        <h4>Agate Rock</h4>
        <p>This piece was something I could pass the chance to try. Thankfully I did, because the results are beautiful! The two coloured lights really brought out the detail in the piece of crystal and gave it a very pretty colour. </p>
        <div class="image" id="agate"></div>

        <h4>Plastic Bag</h4>
        <p>I really like the way the light reflects on the plastic, as it gives the bag a "fractured" feel.</p>
        <div class="image" id="plastic"></div>

        <h4>Glue Stick</h4>
        <p>This one was a bit of a surprise. I was not expecting the whole stick to glow like it did.</p>
        <div class="image" id="glue"></div>

        <h4>Foil</h4>
        <p>Finally, this was my favorite experiment. I could not believe the kind of beautiful images I was able to get from just a piece of foil and some lights. The reflected light feels almost like electricity running through the foil, which I think is really cool.SS </p>
        <div class="image" id="foil1"></div>
        <div class="image" id="foil2"></div>
        <div class="image" id="foil3"></div>

        <h3>EXPERIMENTATION - Code</h3>
        <p>Below is one of the sketches I explored while experimenting with materials. It involves flashing the first Neopixel different colours, and then flashing the second. Throughout my process, I changed the colours to show variety.</p>

        <p>I retrieved my base code from the Adafruit Neopixel example library by Shae Erisson 2013. This is what I edited to experiment with materials.</p>

        <h2>Sprint 2: Motor Challenge</h2>
        <h3>EXPERIMENTATION - Circuit</h3>

        <p>I first started by hooking up the standard motor to a potentiometer and testing that out.</p>
        <div class="image" id="motor1"></div>

        <p>Then I hooked the motor up to a button.</p>
        <div class="image" id="motor2"></div>


        <h3>EXPERIMENTATION - Movement</h3>

        <h3>EXPERIMENTATION - Code</h3>
        <p>For the first movement piece, I used the code from the Servo Motor example library by Scott Fitzgerald.</p>
        <div class="image" id="motorcode1"></div>
        <p>For the second and third experimentation I borrowed online code from ArduinoGetStarted.com </p>
